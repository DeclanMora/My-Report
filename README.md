## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The problem a company like black rock is trying to solve is simple, allow as many people on earth to invest as humanly possible, the more money that is placed into investment the more the wealth grows for everyone. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
This is the beauty of a company like blackrock who utilizes ETF’s as investment tools their market size is everyone within the top ten to twenty percent globally i.e anyone who is making around 20,000 usd a year. ETFs allow nearly anyone within these wealth brackets to  invest as the cost per unit is generally one thousand dollars which although is a lot of money to certain people it isn't out of their grasp entirely, this also allows bigger investors the ability to invest as they can just simply purchase more units. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Simply put the unfair advantage that a company like black rock offers is the sheer size of its capital under management, theoretically black rock has enough assets to be categorized as in the top 10 countries internationally, this allows them to be a force to be reckoned with by no sheer stretch of one's imagination. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The most utilized and unique technologies black rock utilizes i would say would be its use of a program known as aladdin which has been a key tool which allowed black rock to succeed, it integrates various functions in relation to portfolio management, through the use of data sharing and comparisons on a singular network throughout various fields and firms this allows black rock to use aladdin as not only one of their biggest marketable  products but also their biggest tools. 












## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Investment management, risk management and advisory services. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Some of the major trends and innovations of this domain over the past 5-10 years is the exact financial instrument that companies like black rock offer being ETF’s, ETFs was a very interesting concept which allowed the streamlined availability of all three above domains, they are quite simply a bundle of shares and or instruments which are leveraged against each other to give the customer the desired effect, do they want a highly volatile emerging markets index at a ratio of 10% and want it to be counter weighed against a low volatility very secure market at a rate of 90% to maximize the potential profit while maintaining a sustainable and secure growth rate ETFs are the perfect tool for that, do you want to divy your returns between reinvestments and cash in hand dividend payments etfs can allow you to do that, they are quite simply a broad stroke approach to what taylormade investment strategies used to be from your financial advisor and or your own personal investment and or wealth manager although if you contact black rock and its main competitor vanguard they can and will create taylormade portfolios for you at an increased management costs but nothing really is accessible and or with low barriers of entry (the cost) as what etfs allow.    

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

 Other major companies which rival and compete against black rock, generally only one company comes to mind that being vanguard, although there are others such as wellington management, morgan stanley and charles schwab, vanguard is black rocks only true competitor in regards to both retail and commercial scale investment and risk management as well as its advisory services.  













## Results


* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Black rocks business impact on the financial sector could be argued to have been as great in the last 20 years (2006-2022) as what j.p morgan stanley was during the earlier 20th century and or goldman sachs in the japanese (1980-2000) and CFD (1990-2008) days. 
Their true impact has been to deliver on what they set out to do in the form of the etfs and bringing them to the everyday person, due to their low barrier of entry (cost).  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 
How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success is mainly assets under management (capital).
And on a side note as these types of companies although similar to an investment bank or hedge fund it is very hard to measure based returns and or success as etfs are generally different from one another and just allow the investor to choice which is best for them, i.e. puts the financial decision more in the hands of the investor which can have greater impact in both risk and return for them as if the investor is greatly risk averse and chooses very secure and safe investments their returns will not be as good as someone who chooses very risky investments and with quite frankly a little bit of luck could yield much greater returns and or losses. This varies greatly from your traditional hedge fund as when you place money in a hedge fund they generally choose how your money is spent with the underlying promise they will make certain returns for their investors 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Quite frankly they are number one and by no small margin their closest competitor is vanguard which although has accomplished a great deal just on the first metric of capital under management, black rock has 10 trillion in USD under management while as vanguard has 7 trillion in USD under management this is the difference of 30% which if we are talking about by regular business metrics this is a huge difference, when we are talking about the amounts of money which makes up 3 trillion dollars we are talking about close to the entire GDP of australia for a single year this is no small number.   








## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?


Due to the sheer size and market cap of black rock i don't know if there would be any services they could offer they don't already, the only possible things i could think of would be a brokerage service which allowed its clients and customers to buy and sell shares as this would allow for more self managed self tailored ETF for example you purchase 10k worth of a single ETF i.e 10,000,000 dollars of shares with the alphas and betas clearly displayed of what you've invested in you then decide that you don't like a specific company which is displayed within your etf, you then decide to sell said share to repurchase other shares within your ETF, although this would make it no longer and etf in the sense of what they are today, this could allow them to pick up on a market share i believe they're not capitalizing on at the moment being the pseudo active traders i.e. people who buy and sell shares but generally just readjust weekly and or monthly, or as i personally call them the more inactive active traders a class of traders who purchase shares for long term growth but still want to capitalize on short term opportunities when they present themselves. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The technologies this product would utilize would be a more widespread version of a product they already offer, being aladdin, but with an ease of access to everyone, not just blue chip firms. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Well as they already have the template of this technology, i believe if they stream lined a version which was fit for public consumption the profits to the firm i believe would be great.
